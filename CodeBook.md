The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II)  on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

**ADITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT DATASET**

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset is a zip file and his content is structured in 2 directories:

1.- Root: files with data about activities  and features
 


- 'Activity_labels.txt': List all types of activity.(Links the class labels with their activity name).
   Column 1 -> Renamed as "KEY_activity" is the descriptor of activities.
   column 2 -> Renamed as "Name_activity" is the type of activities ( WALKING,etc)



- 'features.txt": list of all features. 
	The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	variables:
	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

	The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 
	
	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation
	mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	max(): Largest value in array
	min(): Smallest value in array
	sma(): Signal magnitude area
	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	iqr(): Interquartile range 
	entropy(): Signal entropy
	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	angle(): Angle between to vectors.
	
	Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
	
	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean


2.- TEST: files with data test:

- 'X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'y_test.txt': Test labels.

- 'subject_test.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

3.- TRAIN: files with data about training set:

- 'X_train.txt': Test set.

- 'y_train.txt': Test labels.

- 'subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

**RESUME PROCESS**

More details in README.md.

STEP 1: Assign labels (variable names) to files (TEST files and TRAIN files) and merge both sets of files in one data set.

STEP 2: From data set select only the variables (columns) for standard deviation and mean.

STEP 3: Merge 'Activity_labels.txt' with data set obtained in step 2 introducing information about Name of activities.

STEP 4: Replacement short description labels (names of variables) for extended description labels.

STEP 5:  From the tidy data set of STEP 4 obtain a new tidy data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject and export to an external '.txt' file named: "second_tidy_data.txt".
